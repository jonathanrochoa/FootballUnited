# FootballUnited
Social Advocacy Project created in CodePath 10-week class. Project developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in Repl.it. Designed to to demonstrate personal learning and visual design efficiency. 

I chose this topic because I am passionate about football, this made the project exciting to research and develop.
